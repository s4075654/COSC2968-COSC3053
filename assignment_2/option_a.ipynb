    "1. Does not account for diagonal or other forms of movements, this may lead to inefficient path-finding where diagonal movements are available.\n",

    "#### Time efficiency of A*:\n",
    "    Worst case scenario, the time efficiency of A* is $O(b^d)$, which means, every single neighbour is visited on the way from the start to the destination. This can occur with ludicrously horrible heuristic functions.\n",
    "    On the other end of extremity, A* will only visit the nodes on the path, resulting in an $O(d)$ time efficiency, with a perfect heuristic function.\n",
    "    Realistically, the performance of A* is between these two extremes, depending mostly on the accuracy of the heuristic function.\n",
    "#### Space efficiency of A*:\n",
    "Due to A* storing all neighbouring as well as path nodes in memory, the space complexity in the worst case can be $O(b^d)$, meaning, as the path length increases, the amount of memory used grows exponentially, making A* unsuitable for path-finding on a large scale.\n",
    "#### The path cost:\n",
    "    The path cost of the solution is the sum of the steps required to make movements from the starting location to the destination, along the optimal path returned by the algorithm.\n",
    "    The path cost would then be the length of the path subtracted by 1."
